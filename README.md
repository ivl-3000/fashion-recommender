# 👗 Fashion Outfit Image Recommender
A Computer Vision + Hybrid RS + Multimodal AI Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a Fashion Outfit Recommendation System for Amazon customers.
It leverages:
- Collaborative Filtering (CF): Learns user-item interactions.
- Image Embeddings (Computer Vision): Captures outfit style & similarity.
- Review Sentiment (NLP): Understands product quality & customer perception.
- Hybrid & Multimodal RS: Combines multiple signals to improve personalization.

**Goal:** Deliver personalized, diverse, and visually appealing outfit recommendations to reduce choice overload and improve customer experience.

## 🎯 Objectives & Deliverables
- Phase 1: Baseline CF recommender (SVD/ALS).
- Phase 2: Content-based recommendations via image embeddings (ResNet/EfficientNet).
- Phase 3: Hybrid recommender (CF + Image).
- Phase 4: Multimodal recommender (CF + Image + Sentiment).
- Phase 5: Dashboards (Power BI/Tableau).

**Final Deliverables:**
- Jupyter notebooks (EDA, embeddings, models, evaluation).
- Model artifacts (models/, embeddings/).
- Recommendation results (CSV/Parquet).
- Power BI dashboard.
- Documentation (PR/FAQ, README, final slides).

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- Offline RS metrics: Precision@K, Recall@K, NDCG.
- Business proxies (simulated): Uplift in CTR, increased diversity & novelty.
- Scalability metrics: Inference time, memory footprint.
